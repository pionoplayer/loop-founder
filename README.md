# loop-founder
Life-loop resource management incremental game.

Basic idea is a "build a world/city/civilization" lifetime/reincarnation incremental where the changes you make persist from loop to loop.

This is an idle project created with the intent of scratching a personal itch while too brain dead to really work on things properly. Most of the difficult coding was done via LLM, on the off chance I include actual artwork at any point it will be commissioned or creative commons.

This will probably be abandoned sooner rather than later.
